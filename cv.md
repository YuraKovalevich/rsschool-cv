2. About me:
I am a 2nd year student at BSU. While still at school, I became interested in programming, so I decided to enter RFiKT. So far, I have completed the 1st course, and I can say that I like it here. I got interested in JS thanks to a friend who told me what an interesting language it is. That's why I ended up here.

3. Skills:
    * C++
    * Java
    * Js
    * Git
